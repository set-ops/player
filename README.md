Welcome to our community! This is the perfect place to ask us questions, report issues and share feature ideas with us. In return, we promise to make the Props Player app (even) better :)

## Install
Digital props come in all ages. For this, the Player app is lightweight and can be installed on devices as old as the iPhone 7 and iPhone SE 2020. And also on many flavours of Android.

Today, the app is released in a controlled environment. Once published, you will be able to purchase the Props Player in the Apple and Google app stores.

## Actors
The player and its host phone are approached as how it's intended: an extension of the character, played by an actor.

It's a simple setup. Any set member knows that an Actor can't (and doesn't want to) be bothered by focus on complex interaction with a digital prop. To tackle this, the onset prop master controls every interaction that needs to be emulated on the mobile phone, directly from the accompanying Remote Control. Including typing and skipping to next actions.

## Offline mode
Even though the Remote Control VS Prop Player interactions are reliant on a connection, the player can effortlessly fall back to an offline auto-play mode and run any scene that has be synced before.
